First, create a new HashMap
loop through each element int nums
    for each element in the array calculate the difference which is the target - current number
    check if that difference is found in the map. 
        If it is return a new int arrary with the first element being the index of the number found in the map, and the second being the index of the current number
        otherwise, sotre the current number, and its index in the map
return null outside the loop
