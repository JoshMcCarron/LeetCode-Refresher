First start off by creating a LinkedList which will hold the sorted merged LinkedList.
Then create a node curr and set it to the head of the new LinkedList.
    While an element is still present in both list1 and list2, traverse through the lists
        compare the values of the current element in either list and set curr.next to which ever is lower
        whichever list is chosen needs to traverse to the next element
        set curr to curr.next
    Outside the loop edge cases need to be handled
        An if statement for if list1 is non-empty, and another for if list2 is non-empty
            in both just set curr.next to the cooresponding list
