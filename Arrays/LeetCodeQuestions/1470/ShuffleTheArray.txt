First, we start off by creating a new array of size n*2.
Then we loop through the entire array
    -the index of x will be every i value * 2, while the index of y will be every i value * 2 + 1
        -this fills the x values with even indices, and the y values with odd indices
    -the value of x will be i, while the value of y will be i + the offset new
Finally, return the array
