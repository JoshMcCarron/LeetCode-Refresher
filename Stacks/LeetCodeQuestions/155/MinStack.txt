So the premise of this solution is to have a default stack and a min stack.
Every time an element is encountered push it to the default stack, and only push it to the min stack if it is empty or if it is lower than or equal to the top of minStack.
For popping, pop from deault stack, and only pop from minStack if element popped from deafult stack is the peek of minStack
